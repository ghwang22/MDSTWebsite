            <img src = "RomansRoadToSalvation.jpg" alt = "Infographic of Romans Road to Salvation stating that 'We are all sinners by nature and by choice' referring to Romans 3:23 and 'We receive eternal life as a free gift' referring to Romans 6:23 and 'We must call and surrender to Jesus as Lord' referring to Romans 5:8 and 'Our assurance of Salvation through Jesus' referring to Romans 10:9-10. This infographic also gives 'A Sinner's Prayer for Salvation' that says, Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.
