                Transcription of 1:30-7:16  <br>
                Podcast host speaks: So what I want to talk about today is I want to talk about humility and what it looks like to actually be humble and what it means to be a humble person, right. Being humble is something that God doesn't just suggest to us, but tells us something that we need to be. When not only walking in our faith, but walking this planet, we just need to be humble. I do believe that a lot of us struggle with staying humble all the time, and I feel like sometimes we do it and we don't even realize that we're not being humble. That means like when we think of somebody who's not humble, we think of the extreme where it's just a really arrogant person and you just can't stand being around them because they act like they're above everyone else and whatever. There's always extremes to everything, but there can be moments in our lives where we are not being humble enough and we don't even realize it.
                <br> <br>
                One of the most common questions that I get on my platforms from some of y'all in the comment section or you know, if l'm live on TikTok or whatever, is how come I'm talking to God and I don't hear him. Like a lot of responses that I get from people are how do I feel Him? How do I hear Him? Because I feel like I pray and I talk to Him, but I don't feel Him moving in my life like I don't feel Him. I want. I want what you're feeling Ally, like people are like I  see the way that you are like overwhelmed by him and I want to feel that why can't I? And obviously there can be a multitude of reasons why you do not feel God. But I really think the biggest culprit to us not feeling God is not being humble enough, not humiliating ourselves in front of God and saying I can't do this without you. I'm incapable of doing anything great without you by my side, you know, and just truly like stripping down to something that is so raw. I think a lot of times it takes pride, and sometimes that is a barrier that is so hard to break when we don't see where it's rooted from or why we can't put down our pride or put aside our pride or put our ego aside and just humble ourselves and admit that we are only human and we cannot do anything without Him. 
                <br> <br>
                I have a couple Bible verses that I want to share with you guys. First being Proverbs 11”2. It reads “when pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.” So that was a verse that I read myself. I was reading Proverbs the other night because I've never read proverbs before and I wanted to start it. And when I read that, I highlighted that and wrote Amen. Next to it underlined it. I loved this verse because I just translated that in my head. The way I took that was that the minute we are humble, the minute we are filled with humility, is the minute that God pours His wisdom into us. But with humility comes wisdom. That is when we truly feel Him moving in our lives. As long as you have that wall up of ego, you will never be able to receive the knowledge and wisdom from God.
                <br> <br> 
                So I want to break down humble and what being humble means in multiple different ways. So I decided to look up the definition of what being humble is. So this is what the Internet says. Not proud, not thinking of yourself as better than any other people, despite all of his achievements, he has remained humble. He is very humble about his achievements. Now personally, I believe that there can be a misconception about what being humble could mean or look like. I think that a lot of times people assume when you humble yourself, it means that you are unimportant or you feel worthless. You're not special or unique. Being humble is being weak or a doormat to just let somebody walk all over you and take advantage of you. But I do believe that there is a significant difference between being humble and having confidence.
                <br> <br>
                I think that you can still have confidence and be humble. Like you can still recognize the value that you offer and bring to the table and the impact that you can make on people's lives or in this world, right? Whatever those hopes, ambitions, dreams are, you can still do it in a humble matter and not allow people to walk all over you. So being humble is not a lack of self worth or confidence. It's a recognition that you are no more important than anyone else. Like your life is not more valuable than another person's life. You may offer different talents or, you know, you may offer different things than the next person, but that doesn't mean that your life is any more important than the next. Ok, so that's the difference between being humble and then just being a dang doormat. Ok we still hold confidence. We know our worth, we know our value, but we also know the worth and value of other people as well. And we acknowledge that the same way that we acknowledge your own. It's not like a one or the other, you know, rather than an arrogant person.
                <br> <br>
                So then I googled what the opposite of being humble is, and it said the opposite of a humble person is an arrogant person, a person who only thinks of themselves and sees themselves as higher and better than others, right? So it's not that you're better than other people. You might be better at a certain thing than another person is, but we are no better than the next person. We are all God's children, and if he looks at us equally as all the same, then that is absolutely the way that we need to be looking at other people.
